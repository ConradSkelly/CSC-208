# Sequence Analysis

Consider the sequence that starts:

$$
a_0 = 3,\, a_1 = 8,\, a_2 = 13,\, a_3 = 18,\, a_4 = 23, \dots
$$

---

## (a) Which of the following could be a recursive definition for the sequence?

notice how the difference between the terms is 5:

$$
a_1 = a_0 + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8
a_2 = a_1 + 5 = 8 + 5 = 13 \\
a_3 = a_2 + 5 = 13 + 5 = 18 \\
a_4 = a_3 + 5 = 18 + 5 = 23
$$

So recursive definition is:

$$
a_n = a_{n-1} + 5,\quad a_0 = 3
$$

**Correct choice:**  
- $$( a_n = a_{n-1} + 5;\ a_0 = 3 )$$

---

## (b) Closed Formula

This is an **arithmetic sequence** with:

- First term $$( a_0 = 3 )$$
- Common difference $$( d = 5 )$$

So the closed formula is:

$$
a_n = 3 + 5n
$$

 **Closed formula:**  
$$( a_n = 3 + 5n )$$

## (c) Is 2598 a term of the sequence?

We want to know if 2598 fits the closed formula:

$$
a_n = 3 + 5n
$$

Start by subtracting the first term:

$$
2598 - 3 = 2595
$$

Then divide by 5:

$$
\frac{2595}{5} = 519
$$

Since 519 is an integer, this means:

$$
a_{519} = 2598
$$

**Answer:**  
$$( a_{519} )$$
