**Problem:**

A multiset is a collection of objects that allows repetition, unlike a regular set. Given the digits \(0\) through \(9\), answer the following:

---

### **a.** How many **sets** of size 5 can be made using the 10 numeric digits \(0\) through \(9\)?

Since sets do not allow repetition and order does not matter, we use combinations:

$$
\text{Number of sets} = \binom{10}{5} = 252
$$

---

### **b.** How many **multisets** of size 5 can be made using the 10 numeric digits \(0\) through \(9\)?

Since multisets allow repetition and order does not matter, we use combinations with repetition (stars and bars):

$$
\text{Number of multisets} = \binom{10 + 5 - 1}{5} = \binom{14}{5} = 2002
$$

---

### **Final Answers:**

- (a) \(252\)
- (b) \(2002\)
