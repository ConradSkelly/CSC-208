## Problem
A combination lock consists of a dial with 45 numbers on it.  
To open the lock:
- You turn the dial to the right to the first number,
- Then left to the second number,
- Then right again to the third number.  
The numbers must be **distinct**.

**Question**:  
How many different combinations are possible?

## Solution
Since the numbers must be distinct:
- There are 45 choices for the first number,
- 44 remaining choices for the second number,
- 43 remaining choices for the third number.

Thus, the total number of different combinations is:

$45 \times 44 \times 43$

Calculating:

$45 \times 44 = 1980$
$1980 \times 43 = 85140$

This is also the same thing as writing:

$_{45}P_{3} = 85140$

## Final Answer
$\boxed{85140}$
