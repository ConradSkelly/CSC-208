## I'm Not a Real Scientist, and That's Okay

### summarizing the article

The author argues that the branch of computer science is not a discipline of science as it is not built upon a system based on observation and hypotheses. Instead, it is better to classify this field as a philosophy, as computer scientists only need to state their assumptions and use logic to back their ideas up.

An example of this is the assumption that open source software is inherently less secure than proprietary software. You can make a logical argument for why this is the case, such as people not being able to see the source code. However, when looking at the data, Microsoft's Windows has had a dramatically larger amount of bugs and exploits found for it (probably because it's so widely used). So even though the data does not back up the assumption, it's still a fine assumption to make as long as it can't be logically disproven.

To sum up the author's idea, there is so much of computer science that can't be formalized that it is often up to the computer scientist's idea about what is best based on their logic. As such, it is better to describe computer science as a branch of philosophy instead of a branch of science or mathematics.

### why I was asked to read it

I believe I was asked to read this because it's important to understand what computer science is. while math and electrical engineering
is important in computer science, it's also important to understand that when faced with a problem we make an assumption about that
problem we use logic to create an answer that makes sense to us ie what programming language, to use whether to use an array hashmap or link list, ect
its also going to be important for this class as I'm imaging we are going to make mathematical assumptions and then use mathematical logic (proofs)
in order to come to an answer

## John Hopcroft

* John Hopcroft's coauthored texts with Robert Tarjan on formal languages and their relation to automata 
* In 1986, he received the Turing Award for fundamental achievements in the design and analysis of algorithms and data structures
* created the Hopcroftâ€“Karp algorithm 

## Robert Tarjan

* His work has helped lay the groundwork for the analysis of algorithms, particularly in understanding the efficiency and complexity of various computational processes.
* he made contributions to the design and analysis of data structures, including the development of the Fibonacci heap, which is particularly useful in network optimization algorithms.
